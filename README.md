## 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗠𝗲 - 
I am a Data Scientist with 3 years of experience. I enjoy the process of finding insights, experimenting techniques and bringing solutions to a problem. To me, the role of a data scientist is just like a detective. You gather the data from different sources, clean and transform the data, find insights and draw conclusions out of them; just like a detective solving a mystery.

***"Process is important than the results"*** <br>
Enjoying the process is always important than the results. Results are, in fact, a byproduct of the process. Successes and Failures both, are inevitable but should be treated equally and what matters the most is what you learn out of it. 

***"Do what you can't"*** <br>
Try and constantly push yourself to do the things which you think that you can’t do. 

***"Karma is a boomerang"*** <br>
What you sow is what you reap. I believe in what you do today, be it good or bad, will come back to you. 

***"Known is a Drop, and unknown is an Ocean."*** <br>
Stay humble and stay curious for you will always have various things to learn from different people.
