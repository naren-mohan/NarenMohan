I am from the silicon valley of India, currently pursuing my Master's degree at Northeastern University, Boston. Since childhood, I was fond of two things - Math and Computers. The passion in these two things have made me quit my high paying job and have brought me 14,000 kms far from my home to pursue my higher education in Data Analytics. I believe that the best application of these two things is in the field of Data Science to make deeper insights which are very crucial to any businesses. I also have over 3 years of professional experience working as a Senior Software Engineer analysing the vulnerability data for Sony.
