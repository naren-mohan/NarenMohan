### 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗠𝗲 - 
I love to dig into problems and use modern technologies to solve them. I enjoy the process of penning the objective, listing the assumptions, bringing solutions to the problem and evaluating them. I am a Data Analyst and an aspiring Data Scientist with 3 years of experience for Sony in analyzing the vulnerability data and planning the vulnerability remediation process for the platform teams.

The role of a Data Scientist, to me, is essentially playing the role of a detective. You gather data from various sources, you clean and organize the data, you apply various techniques and algorithms to find deeper insights and finally you draw conclusions out of the data, just like a detective would to solve the crime. 
In the modern days, almost all businesses collect and store data. The best way to benefit from this valuable resource is by making analyses, applying strategies, understanding the data and thus, improving the business with it.

> "Process is important than the results"
Enjoying the process is always important than the results. Results are, in fact, a byproduct of the process. Successes and Failures both, are inevitable but should be treated equally and what matters the most is what you learn out of it. 

> "Do what you can't"
Try and constantly push yourself to do the things which you think that you can’t do. 

> "Karma is a boomerang"
What you sow is what you reap. I believe in what you do today, be it good or bad, will come back to you. 

> "Known is a Drop, and unknown is an Ocean." 
Stay humble and stay curious for you will always have various things to learn from different people.
