I am from the silicon valley of India, currently pursuing my Master's degree at Northeastern University, Boston. Since childhood, I was fond of two things - Math and Computers. The passion in these two things have made me quit my high paying job and have brought me 14,000 kms far from my home to pursue my higher education in Data Analytics. I believe that the best application of these two things is in the field of Data Science to make deeper insights which are very crucial to any businesses. I also have over 3 years of professional experience working as a Senior Software Engineer analysing the vulnerability data for Sony.

<!-- Write stuff about my interest in data science in here -->
In the recent days, the term "Data Science" is booming and the job market is filled with companies that wants to hire Data Scientists. What's special about Data Science?! Well, firstly, Data Science is all about making sense out of a given data and I believe that Data Science is not something new. It has been there for hundreds of years. However, it was used for large size problems. For example, during the 18th century, Herman Hollerith invented the Tabulating machine that enabled the researchers to extrapolate different forms of the census data. Nowadays, the data science is applied on macro level problems which, however, impacts the business in large terms. Also, the data is available now in digital formats, thus, making it more easier to be processed by a computer. This has enabled the businesses to use data science to find those deeper level insights to gain an advantage over competitors. I enjoy finding these insights because of the variety of data that I will be handling and incorporating them into work making a bigger impact for an organization.
