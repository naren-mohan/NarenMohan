I am Naren Mohan, from the silicon valley of India, currently pursuing my Master's degree at Northeastern University, Boston. Since childhood, I was fond of two things - Maths and Computers. The passion in these two things have brought me 14,000 kms from India to USA to pursue my higher education in Data Analytics. In fact, I believe that the best application of these two things is in the field of Data Science to make deeper insights and these insights are very crucial to any businesses. I have over 3 years of professional experience working with Sony as a Senior Software Engineer in the Vulnerability Management domain.
