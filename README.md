<!-- Add medium blog here -->

I am from the silicon valley of India, currently pursuing my Master's degree at Northeastern University, Boston. Since childhood, I was fond of two things - Math and Computers. The passion in these two things have made me quit my decently high paying job, and have brought me 14,000 kms far from my home to pursue my higher education in Data Analytics. I believe that the best application of these two things is in the field of Data Science to make deeper insights that are crucial to businesses. I have 3 years of professional experience working as a Senior Software Engineer analysing the vulnerability data for Sony.

### What makes Data Science so exciting? 

The role of a Data Scientist is like the role of a detective. You gather data from various sources, you clean and organize the data, you apply techniques and algorithms to find deeper insights about the data and finally you draw conclusions out of the data. In the modern days, data is one of the main features of any business. Data in its raw, unstructured form usually doesn't make much of a sense. The best way to benefit from this valuable resource is by making analyses, applying strategies, thus understanding the data and improving the business with it.
